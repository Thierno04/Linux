Here I explain what the Web Server HTTPD service is, how we can configure a web server in our Linux CENTOS environment, deploy our first simple HTML web page and how we can access our web page from a browser .

What is HTTPD ?
--------------
HTTPD Daemon is a software program that runs in the background of a web  server and waits for the incoming server requests.

The daemon answers the request automatically and serves the hypertext and multimedia documents over the internet unsing HTTP.

yum install httpd (apache2)
httpd --version

Config location:
----------------
/etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf
/var/www/html/index.html (we need to add this file)

Logs:
----
log var/log/httpd

How to start service
--------------------
systemctl start httpd

example:
-------
cd /etc/httpd/conf
ls
less httpd.conf
cd /var/www/
ls
cd html/
pwd
vi index.html
systemctl start httpd
ip addr or ifconfig
systemctl status firewalld.service
