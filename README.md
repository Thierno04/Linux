# What is linux?
Linux is an imitation of Unix and Unix is a system that appeared in the 70s and in terms of performance at the time it was far from what follows today.

Here we talked about the operating system which is called the kernel.
#### The kernel
will be in charge of communicating with the hardware and using the hardware resource at its disposal.

So linux is the kernel of the system and the tool that allows us to communicate with the kernel and to access it indirectly to use it and this tool is called the shell and thanks to the shell we ensure that the orders that 'we will give the computer will be interpreted correctly by the kernel and that we will not have to do things as indicated to succeed in accessing the hardware.

You can give simple orders to "the computer" and the shell communicates with the kernel to execute its orders.

#### Two main shell families:
The text shell: Bash
The graphical shell: Window, KDE, Unity...
